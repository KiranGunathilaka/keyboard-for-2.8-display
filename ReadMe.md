# Keyboard for 2.8 inch touch display

This keyboard is originally written with the intent of acquiring the WiFi password from a user via the touch display. Feel free to modify as you want. (I didn't know there is something called SquareLine Studio and LVGL for embedded UI Developemnt 😐)

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="Images/CapsOff.jpg" alt="Caps Off" width="45%" />
  <img src="Images/CapsOn.jpg" alt="Caps On" width="45%" />
</div>
